Legend:
- Host publishes only app: host:80 -> app:8080
- DB containers do NOT publish ports to host; reachable only inside the Docker network
- Service discovery inside the network uses service names: postgres:5432, mongo:27017, redis:6379

```

## âœ¨ Key Highlights
- **Secure container networking**: DB services are not exposed to the internet â€” only accessible to the API via service names (`postgres`, `mongo`, `redis`).
- **Environmentâ€‘based config**: `.env` file controls connection strings, JWT secrets, and environment settings.
- **Cloudâ€‘ready**: Configured for deployment on AWS EC2 with minimal changes from local dev.
- **Scalable foundation**: Easily extendable to Kubernetes or ECS in the future.

## ðŸ“š What I Learned
This project was as much about building a backend as it was about mastering the **endâ€‘toâ€‘end delivery pipeline**.

Key takeaways:
- **Docker Networking**: How containers communicate internally without exposing sensitive ports, and how service discovery works via Compose service names.
- **Environment Management**: Using `.env` files to separate local and cloud configurations cleanly.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Provisioning and securing an EC2 instance, mapping container ports to host ports, and configuring security groups.
- **Service Orchestration**: Running multiple dependent services (API, Postgres, Mongo, Redis) in a single Compose stack with proper startup order.
- **Operational Resilience**: Using restart policies and systemd integration to ensure the app survives EC2 reboots.
- **Security Awareness**: Minimising attack surface by keeping databases internalâ€‘only and exposing only the API.
